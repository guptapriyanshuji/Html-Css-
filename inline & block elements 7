    <!--  i write this is a paragraph and if i write this is also a paragraph then what will happen 
    it is in different line, i'd written here itself why did this is a paragraph jump to a different 
    line? i want to tell you paragraph is a block element. block element means it takes up the entire 
    width. and any element that is next will be after it. 
     
    if i span this paragraph, and span this well then see what happens there's this is a paragraph 
    and this is also a paragraph  this is because span tag  is an inline elements 
    inline elements come in same line 


    block elements take up the entire space elements that take only their space are inline-->
<p>this is a paragraph</p>
<p>this is also a paragraph</p>
<span>this is s span</span> <span>this is also a span</span>
