    <h2>This is a html forms tutorial</h2>
    <form action ="backend.php">
        <!-- you can see that role is in same line i wanted it in the next line i have two options
        now , either use br tag for line break or what can i do is it's better technique .
        i will use division tags or div tag what is the use of div tags ? it's used to bring a
        division  the effect of doing now it came down this happened because of my input tag, 
        that is an inline element, span is an inline element. and what's div? Div is a block element 
        it takes up an entire block as width and the next element has to go down. that's why i used div, 
        we will discuss this later. we used the div for it be in the next line i don't recommend using
        br tag. we will avoid br as much as possible in our design.  so i did this and then, even 
        if i use a br , nothing will happen. there will only be a space and my form will look good 
        but we will achieve this using css.  using margin and padding 
        -->

        <!-- and i will also quickly explains label tags. suppose i ant to add a label, i'll show one and you can 
        do the rest yourself.  i'll write label then for = name. i'll take the id as name.-->

        <label for ="Name"></label>
    
        <div>
             Name: <input type = "text" name = "myName"> <!-- i will explain the name is now  name is 
            what your backend will recogonise this by when putting the data in backend  like i am
            doing in backend.php, so backend.php has to identify everything. it will say this is my 
            Name . so backend will have a way to take value of myName -->
